Note
----

Relies heavily and thanks to:
- ozodrukh's <a href="https://github.com/ozodrukh/CircularReveal">CircularReveal<a/>
- Jake Wharton's <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids">NineOldAndroids<a/>

Requirements
------------

Minimum SDK level of API 9 (2.3+). However as of this writing, the animation will only occur on API 21 (5.0+). When implemented in API below 21, normal activity transition will occur.
